# STAT5320 Applied Stats in Data Mining
This project analyzes the Boston housing market using the updated Boston-corrected dataset, which includes additional socio-economic and geographic variables to provide a deeper, more ethically informed analysis. The study employs advanced statistical methods such as stepwise regression and Lasso regularization within a rigorous exploratory data analysis framework to identify key determinants of housing prices. Ethical considerations were central, leading to the exclusion of variables like B and LSTAT to prevent bias propagation. The findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners, enhancing the understanding of urban housing dynamics and supporting informed decision-making.
